# Badge2 Bluetooth Client Documentation

## Overview

The Badge2 app is a Bluetooth LE peripheral that allows remote devices to update the displayed text. The text is persistently stored and will be restored when the app is relaunched.

**Technical Note**: The app uses MicroPython's `aioble` library for Bluetooth operations. Bluetooth operations run synchronously in the main update loop using `asyncio.run()`, so the display may pause briefly during connection establishment and data transfers.

## Architecture

The app uses a simple state machine in the `update()` loop:
1. **idle** → Starts advertising the device via Bluetooth LE
2. **advertising** → Blocks waiting for incoming connection
3. **connected** → Listens for writes to the text characteristic (2 second timeout)
4. Updates the display and saves text when new data is received
5. Automatically returns to idle state after disconnection or errors

## Bluetooth Service Details

### Service UUID
```
12345678-1234-5678-1234-56789abcdef0
```

### Characteristic UUID (Text)
```
12345678-1234-5678-1234-56789abcdef1
```

**Properties:**
- Read: Yes
- Write: Yes
- Notify: No

### Characteristic UUID (Password)
```
12345678-1234-5678-1234-56789abcdef2
```

**Properties:**
- Read: Yes (returns current 4-digit password in plain text)
- Write: No (password is randomly generated by badge, cannot be changed remotely)
- Notify: No

**Password Authentication:**
The badge generates a random 4-character alphanumeric password on boot. This password must be included with all text write operations. The password is displayed on the badge screen along with a QR code for easy access.

**Password Format:**
- Exactly 4 alphanumeric characters (e.g., "A7K2", "Q3M9")
- Generated randomly on badge boot/reset
- Readable via characteristic for verification
- Prevents casual trolling at conferences, not designed for strong security

## Connection Process

1. **Discovery**: Scan for BLE devices advertising the name `"badge2-text"`

2. **Connect**: Establish a connection to the device

3. **Service Discovery**: Discover the text service using UUID `12345678-1234-5678-1234-56789abcdef0`

4. **Characteristic Discovery**: Find the text characteristic using UUID `12345678-1234-5678-1234-56789abcdef1`

## Reading Current Text

To read the currently displayed text:

```python
# Read the characteristic value
data = await text_characteristic.read()
current_text = data.decode('utf-8')
print(f"Current text: {current_text}")
```

## Writing New Text

All text writes must include the 4-character password:

```python
import json

# Read the password from badge first
password_data = await password_characteristic.read()
badge_password = password_data.decode('utf-8')

# Prepare authenticated payload
payload = {
    "password": badge_password,
    "text": "Hello from my device!"
}

# Encode as JSON and write
data = json.dumps(payload).encode('utf-8')
await text_characteristic.write(data)
```

**Authentication Rules:**
- All writes must be JSON with `password` and `text` fields
- Password is compared as plain text (case-sensitive)
- If password doesn't match, write is rejected silently
- No attempt limiting - incorrect password just fails the write

**Text Constraints:**
- Encoding: UTF-8
- Max recommended length: ~50 characters (for single line display)
- Longer text will be word-wrapped automatically
- No strict limit, but very long text may be truncated or difficult to read

## Reading Password

To get the badge's current password:

```python
# Read password characteristic
data = await password_characteristic.read()
badge_password = data.decode('utf-8')
print(f"Badge password: {badge_password}")  # e.g., "A7K2"
```

**Note:** The password is returned in plain text. It's also displayed on the badge screen for manual entry.

## Example Client Code (Python with aioble)

```python
import asyncio

                    return False
    
    print("Badge not found")
    return False

# Usage examples
asyncio.run(update_badge_text("Hello Universe 2025!"))  # No password
asyncio.run(update_badge_text("Secure message", password="mySecret123"))  # With password
```

## Example Client Code (Web Bluetooth API)

```javascript
async function updateBadgeText(newText, password = null) {
    try {
        // Request device
        const device = await navigator.bluetooth.requestDevice({
            filters: [{ name: 'badge2-text' }],
            optionalServices: ['12345678-1234-5678-1234-56789abcdef0']
        });
        
        // Connect to GATT server
        const server = await device.gatt.connect();
        console.log('Connected!');
        
        // Get service
        const service = await server.getPrimaryService(
            '12345678-1234-5678-1234-56789abcdef0'
        );
        
        // Get characteristics
        const textCharacteristic = await service.getCharacteristic(
            '12345678-1234-5678-1234-56789abcdef1'
        );
        const passwordCharacteristic = await service.getCharacteristic(
            '12345678-1234-5678-1234-56789abcdef2'
        );
        
        // Read the badge password
        const passwordValue = await passwordCharacteristic.readValue();
        const badgePassword = new TextDecoder().decode(passwordValue);
        console.log('Badge password:', badgePassword);
        
        // Read current text
        const currentValue = await textCharacteristic.readValue();
        const currentText = new TextDecoder().decode(currentValue);
        console.log('Current text:', currentText);
        
        // Use provided password or read from badge
        const authPassword = password || badgePassword;
        
        // Prepare authenticated write
        const payload = {
            password: authPassword,
            text: newText
        };
        const encoder = new TextEncoder();
        const data = encoder.encode(JSON.stringify(payload));
        
        // Write new text
        await textCharacteristic.writeValue(data);
        console.log('Text updated to:', newText);
        
        // Disconnect
        device.gatt.disconnect();
        
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error:', error);
    }
}

// Usage examples
updateBadgeText("Hello from the web!");  // Reads password from badge automatically
updateBadgeText("Secure message", "A7K2");  // With explicit password (from URL param)
```

## QR Code Integration

The badge displays its 4-character password on screen along with a QR code:

```
https://yourdomain.com/badge-plus-plus?password=A7K2
```

**QR Code Workflow:**
1. Badge generates random 4-character password on boot (e.g., "A7K2")
2. Badge displays password and QR code on screen
3. User scans QR code with phone
4. Browser opens Badge++ page with password pre-filled in URL
5. User clicks "Connect Badge" button (required by Web Bluetooth security)
6. Password is automatically used for all text transmissions
7. Password persists until badge is power-cycled/reset

**URL Parameter Format:**
```
/badge-plus-plus?password=A7K2
```

**Benefits:**
- Simple 4-character password easy to read and type manually if needed
- QR code eliminates manual entry
- Physical access to badge screen required
- Prevents casual conference trolling without complex security
- Password visible on badge so owner can share access intentionally

## Status Display

The badge displays connection status at the top of the screen:

- **"Ready"**: Initialized and ready to start
- **"Starting..."**: Initializing Bluetooth advertising
- **"Advertising..."**: Ready for connections, discoverable as "badge2-text"
- **"Waiting for conn..."**: Blocking, waiting for a device to connect
- **"Connected!"**: Client successfully connected
- **"Listening..."**: Waiting for data writes (2 second timeout loop)
- **"Updated!"**: New text was successfully received and saved
- **"Auth failed"**: Write rejected due to incorrect password
- **"Disconnected"**: Client disconnected, will restart advertising
- **"Write error"**: Error receiving data from client
- **"BT Error"**: Bluetooth error occurred, will retry from idle state

**Password Display:**
- 4-character password displayed prominently on screen
- QR code shown for quick mobile access

## Persistence

- Text is automatically saved to `/badge2_text.json` on the device
- Text is loaded when the app starts
- Default text: "The quick brown fox jumps"
- Password is regenerated on each boot (not persisted)

## Limitations & Notes

1. **Single Connection**: The badge accepts one connection at a time
2. **Simple Authentication**: 4-character password prevents casual trolling, not designed for strong security
3. **Text Encoding**: Must be valid UTF-8
4. **Display Wrapping**: Text longer than screen width is automatically word-wrapped
5. **Blocking Operations**: Display updates pause during connection establishment and data transfers
6. **Write Timeout**: 2 second timeout when listening for writes (to keep display responsive)
7. **Auto-Reconnect**: Automatically returns to advertising after disconnection
8. **Password on Boot**: New password generated each time badge boots/resets
9. **Plain Text Passwords**: Passwords readable via characteristic and visible on screen
10. **JSON Payload**: All writes must use JSON format with password and text fields

## Troubleshooting

**Badge not found during scan:**
- Ensure the badge2 app is running (you should see "Advertising..." in the status bar)
- Check that Bluetooth is enabled on your device
- Move closer to the badge (BLE range is typically 10-30 feet)
- The badge must have Bluetooth modules available (hardware requirement)

**Status shows "BT unavailable":**
- The badge hardware doesn't have Bluetooth modules loaded
- This is expected in development/simulation environments

**Status shows "BT Error":**
- There was an exception in the Bluetooth code
- Check the badge console for error details
- Try restarting the app

**Write fails:**
- Ensure data is properly UTF-8 encoded
- Check that the connection is still active
- Verify you're writing to the correct characteristic UUID
- If password is set, ensure JSON payload includes correct password
- Check status for "Auth failed" message indicating wrong password
- Some platforms require pairing even though the badge doesn't enforce it

**Authentication errors:**
- Badge shows "Auth failed" when password is incorrect
- Write silently fails with wrong password (no disconnect)
- Read password characteristic to get current 4-character password
- Ensure JSON payload format is correct: `{"password": "A7K2", "text": "Hello"}`
- Password is case-sensitive

**Text not persisting:**
- Check that the device has sufficient storage space
- Ensure the app exits cleanly (not force-killed)
- The save file is `/badge2_text.json` in the root filesystem

**Connection drops frequently:**
- Move closer to the badge
- Reduce interference from other Bluetooth devices
- Some platforms have more stable BLE stacks than others

## Technical Details

**State Machine Implementation:**
The app uses a simple state machine (`bt_phase`) with three states:
- `idle`: Ready to start advertising
- `advertising`: Currently advertising and waiting for connection
- `connected`: Client connected, listening for writes

**Synchronous Bluetooth Operations:**
All async operations are executed synchronously using `asyncio.run()`:
- `asyncio.run(state["advertising"])` - Blocks until connection established
- `asyncio.run(asyncio.wait_for(text_characteristic.written(), timeout=2.0))` - Blocks up to 2 seconds waiting for writes

**Connection Flow:**
1. `init()` generates random 4-character password, sets up GATT service with text and password characteristics
2. Displays password and QR code on screen
3. `update()` calls `handle_bluetooth()` every frame
4. On `idle`: Starts advertising via `aioble.advertise()`
5. On `advertising`: Blocks waiting for connection (display pauses)
6. On `connected`: Polls for writes with 2-second timeout, then continues
7. On write: 
   - Parses JSON payload
   - Validates password field matches generated password (plain text comparison)
   - If valid: extracts text, updates display, saves to file
   - If invalid: shows "Auth failed" status, continues listening
8. On disconnect/error: Returns to `idle` and restarts

**Performance Considerations:**
- Display updates pause during connection establishment (typically < 1 second)
- 2-second timeout keeps the listening loop responsive
- Text saves are synchronous but fast (JSON write)
- State updates are immediate and visible in next frame after timeout

## Security Considerations

**Authentication Model:**
- Simple 4-character password prevents casual conference trolling
- Password generated randomly on boot, not user-settable
- Plain text passwords sent in JSON payload and readable via characteristic
- Password visible on badge screen for manual entry
- No attempt limiting or brute force protection

**Threat Model:**
- **Target**: Prevent random conference attendees from trolling badge displays
- **Casual Tampering**: ✓ Mitigated - requires knowing/reading 4-character password
- **Determined Attacker**: ✗ Not mitigated - only 456,976 possible 4-character combinations
- **Physical Access**: ✗ Not mitigated - password visible on screen
- **BLE Sniffing**: ✗ Not mitigated - password sent in plain text
- **Brute Force**: ✗ Not mitigated - no attempt limiting (could try all combos in ~1 hour)

**Intended Use:**
- Conference badges where casual trolling prevention is desired
- Fun personal projects where security isn't critical
- Demonstrations where physical access control exists
- **Not suitable for**: Sensitive data, financial info, authentication tokens

**Design Philosophy:**
- Simplicity over strong security
- Easy to share access (show screen, scan QR, or read 4 chars)
- No lockout risk (password resets on boot)
- Transparent operation (password always visible)

**QR Code Security:**
- Password embedded in URL visible to anyone who sees QR code or screen
- Physical security of badge controls access
- Anyone with camera access to badge can gain control
- Acceptable for conference/demo use cases
